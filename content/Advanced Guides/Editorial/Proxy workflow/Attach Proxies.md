When receiving RAW and previously created proxies, first import the RAW, then link to the proxies using this method.

Step 1 – Select desired RAW footage files , right click, and select “Proxy” → “Attach Proxies...”

Step 2 – Select the first file of footage list. Click “Attach.”

Step 3 – Use the “Search” button or search manually to find correct corresponding proxy. Click “Okay” once selected. It should connect to all proxies. If some remain unlinked, re-do this step with those files.
