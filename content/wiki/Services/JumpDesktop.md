We use JumpDesktop to connect remotly to any VAULT computer.

**Install Jump Desktop on Home Computer**

> If you don't have credentials and the license, please reach out [[wiki/VAULT 101/Key Contacts#^087fb8|Charlie Parker]].

- For Macs, download license: Mac License. Then, in Jump Desktop, click on the free trial link in the upper right corner (tiny white text above the search bar) and import the license. 

Once in, you’ll see the list of all of VAULT’s computers. I recommend that you find each computer you need access to, hover and click on “Edit Settings” and add a tag. This will create a folder in the sidebar for quick access. 

- When remotely accessing a Mac, to get audio to work make sure the following is set on the office computer: 

- In system sound settings, output and input will need to be set to “Jump Desktop Audio” 

- In Premiere, go to Preferences > Audio Hardware > Default Output, set to “Jump Desktop Audio”
