Conform is laying back the colored assets into Premiere after they are color graded.
###### STEP 1
Paste the graded footage onto the server under 02_Assets > 05_Color in a subfolder labeled with the date. If the colorist is a Vault member and has access to the server, this will be their export folder.
###### STEP 2
Within Premiere, import the files into the 05_Color folder. 
###### STEP 3
If you haven’t yet, duplicate your approved sequence and add the suffix "\_CONFORM”.
###### STEP 4
In the Project window, highlight all the newly graded clips, right click and assign them a unique color label (e.g. Teal) to distinguish them from the original files.
###### STEP 5
Then do the same with a different color (e.g. Magenta) for all VFX/MoGFX files in the timeline. This makes it easy to know which clips need to remain above the graded files.
###### STEP 6
Add the graded clips on top of the raw footage and trim all footage handles. Double check to make the grade is lining up with the original edit frame-for-frame. Set the opacity blend mode to “Difference” in Effect Controls. Alternatively, toggle the “eye” icon on the video layer or disable/enable individual clips using CMD + shift + E.

> [!TIP]
> If you duplicate your clips to a new layer, then you can drag and drop from the preview monitor to the clip in the  timeline while holding the Option key on your keyboard to keep all the properties and effects from the original shot to the graded shot.

###### STEP 7
Make sure any text, overlays, or graphics layers remain above the new graded footage clips. Add back in any previously used transitions. Make sure to paste the newly graded footage into the corresponding nests, if applicable.
###### STEP 8
Then, disable all ungraded video clips on tracks that are below your graded footage, but keep them in the timeline. This ensures the working files and finishing files are all in the same sequence for easy unarchiving in the future.
###### STEP 9
You are now ready for export!
