Farmer's Wife is the internal system VAULT uses to assign projects and track worked hours. Each project has its own internal VAULT code, which defers from [[wiki/VAULT 101/Timesheets|AURA-SAP-FIORI]]. 

Your Farmer's Wife week should match your [[wiki/VAULT 101/Timesheets|AURA-SAP-FIORI timesheet]], although you can skip to add non-billable work like doctor's appointments, PTOs, etc.

Ask your producer to add or remove projects from your week.

> 
> If you have an assigned project on a day and you didn't work on it that day, you can set the hours to 06:00am to 06:00am and it will be out of your daily schedule for that day.
