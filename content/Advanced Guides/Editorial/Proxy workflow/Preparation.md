A proxy is a smaller, compressed version of a large, high-resolution RAW file. Proxy workflows help editors easily edit RAW files.

**Folder Creation:** In the root of the footage folder, create a '\_proxies' folder. Subfolders may be created to reflect the RAW folder structures.

**Examine RAW Footage Settings:** After import, examine the footage settings in Premiere’s project panel, scrolling to the right, and adjusting columns. If needed, right click on the top bar and select “Metadata Display...” to adjust properties appearing.

> [!Tip]
> Source Footage Summary resides in the export panels of Premiere and/or Media Encoder.
