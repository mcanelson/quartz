This website is the platform used to share all video exports and receive feedback. Some clients (like intel) require all links to have a password. Please see Frame.io instructions on how to post and share in this tool. You can access to it by logging in at http://app.frame.io.

Please don't use frameIO to share files for internal VAULT use like sharing animations for an edit, sharing [[External Services/Stock Sites|stock footage]] for a pitch, etc.; use the server instead and share the path. If not possible, tell the other side to delete the folder after downloading such files.

Once inside your account, you need to add yourself to the Team you need to work with, so if for example you need to start working on a project for Wendy's you'll need to click on to the word 'VAULT' on the top left corner, from the drop down menu click on 'Add Members' which will take you to a new screen. Select 'Team Directory' on the left menu and search for 'Wendy's' from the list on the right. Once you found it, click **Join**. 

Now you can click on the 'Back to App' button on the top left corner and the Wendy's team and all their projects will show up. **Check with your producer the name and location of the project you need to work on.**

**To leave a team**, is the same procedure as to join, but you just click on the 'Leave' instead of 'Join'.
