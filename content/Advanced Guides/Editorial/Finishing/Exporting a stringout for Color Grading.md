Color prep can be done by exporting a high-resolution version of the approved sequence(s).

This may be the preferred method if:
- There is not time or budget for a full conform.  
- A timeline is too complex to translate between applications. - The footage is causing errors through other means.
###### STEP 1 – PREPARE THE SEQUENCE

A – Duplicate the approved sequence(s) and add the suffix “\_ColorPrep.”

B – In “\_ColorPrep” timeline(s), remove unneeded visual elements that would interfere with the color grade (titles, color, graphics, overlays, etc). use Sequence > Simplify Sequence and check all applicable boxes.

C – In Sequence > Sequence Settings, turn on Maximum Bit Depth and Maximum Render Quality.
###### STEP 2 – EXPORT

To export, go to “File > Export > Media” or go to the Export tab. Use QuickTime format with ProRes 444 codec and 16 bit color depth, unless specified otherwise. Click Render at “Maximum Depth” and “Maximum Render Quality.” This will ensure a high fidelity render but will increase export time and file size.
###### STEP 3 – XML (Optional)

Your colorist may still prefer to receive an XML or EDL of the sequence to help in identifying the cuts and transitions. If so, go to “File > Export > Final Cut Pro XML” and export an XML to “02_Assets/05_Color/00_ColorPrep”. See pages 9 – 11 for details.
