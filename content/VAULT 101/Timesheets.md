SAP â€“ This is the system we use to put time against job numbers. You can also record sick time, personal time, and vacation here. You need to ask your [[The Team/VAULT Post-Producers|producer]] for the SAP project code to fill up your timesheets **before next week Tuesday noon.**

> [!warning]
> If timesheets are not submitted on time, you'll be locked out of Teams and Outlook.

Although an application exists to enter this time, it is recommended to use the webpage version for ease of use.
