Proxies can be created multiple ways, but the below is best practice.

Step 1 – Import the raw footage, select desired clips, right click, and select “Proxy” -> “Create Proxies...”

Step 2 – In the Proxy menu, select “QuickTime” for “Format” and “ProRes Low Resolution Proxy” for “Preset.” Browse to set the “Destination.” When there are multiple destinations, export files by folder.

**AUTO INGEST**

Premiere allows for automatic creation of proxies upon import.

Step 1 – Go to File -> Project Settings -> Ingest Settings.

Step 2 – Click the checkmark box next to “Ingest”. Use the drop down to select “Create proxies” Select preset and destination. Warning! Make sure to un-click the checkmark box to prevent unwanted proxies in the future.

If issues arise, a new preset can be created for future proxy exports. Alternatively, although not ideal, Media Encoder can be used directly to export proxy files. See “Export Settings.“
