While editing with linked to RAW footage, the edit will show proxies while exporting and sending XMLs will reference the RAW media. Switch between viewing RAW and proxy footage with the _Toggle Button_ in the tool bar of Premiere’s Program window.

If Toggle icon doesn’t appear, click on the plus button, find the Toggle icon, and drag it to the tool bar.

> [!Tip]
> After adding proxies to a sequence, right click and use “Scale to frame size” to prevent potential scaling issues if a clip replacement is later required.
