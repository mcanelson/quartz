Farmer's Wife is the internal system VAULT uses to assign projects, hold time, report time, and submit vacation requests. Each project has its own internal VAULT code, which defers from [[VAULT 101/Timesheets|AURA-SAP-FIORI]]. 
You can access to it by logging in at https://vmlyr.farmerswife.com/

Your Farmer's Wife week should match your [[VAULT 101/Timesheets|AURA-SAP-FIORI timesheet]], although you can skip to add non-billable work like doctor's appointments, PTOs, etc. Although this isn’t the official time keeping system for final hours, it is used by producers to estimate time spent and schedule out future projects. View the schedule by day, week or month; view others’ schedules as well. Contact the producer to adjust holds or remove any blocks of time.

**Enter Time**: Keep your time up to date by double clicking on holds on the calendar and adjust the time per project. Passed, but unentered, time will appear in the left column. Notes can be made, like job numbers, in each block of time.

**Add New Time**: Clicking the Plus button in the bottom left or select by selecting and dragging the mouse to make a new time entry. Vacation time can be Requested and personal time can be entered via Tasks or Request. Ad-hoc time is the list of all active jobs if you need to add a job to the week.

> If you have an assigned project on a day and you didn't work on it that day, you can set the hours to 06:00am to 06:00am and it will be out of your daily schedule for that day.
