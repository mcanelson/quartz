This website is the platform we use to share all video exports and receive feedback. Some clients (like intel) require all links to have a password. Please see Frame.io instructions on how to post and share. You can access to it by logging in at http://app.frame.io.

> 
> Your credentials for frame.io are not your WPP login, but a unique individual login using your VML email. . If you don't have credentials, please reach out [[VAULT 101/Key Contacts#^087fb8|Charlie Parker]].

Once inside your account, you need to add yourself to the Client you need to work with from the [Team Directory](https://app.frame.io/account?k=directory), so if for example you need to start working on a project for Wendy's you'll need to click on to the word 'VAULT' on the top left corner, from the drop down menu click on 'Add Members' which will take you to a new screen. Select 'Team Directory' on the left menu and search for 'Wendy's' from the list on the right. Once you found it, click **Join**. 

Now you can click on the 'Back to App' button on the top left corner and the Wendy's team and all their projects will show up. **Check with your producer the name and location of the project you need to work on.**

**To leave a team**, is the same procedure as to join, but you just click on 'Leave'.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please don't use frameIO to share files for internal VAULT use like sharing animations for an edit, sharing [[External Services/Stock Sites|stock footage]] for a pitch, etc.; use the server instead and share the path. If not possible, tell the other side to delete the folder after downloading such files.

## Create a new project

###### Step 1
Next to the correct Client/Brand, click the plus bottom.
###### Step 2
A new project window will pop up. Enter the Project Name. This should match the name of the project on the server.
###### Step 3
In the settings below, make sure Download Files is toggled on (should be automatically). Feel free to adjust the notifications settings as you see fit. The recommended settings are shown to the left – toggling off everything except ”New Comment.”
###### Step 4
Click Create Project.
###### Step 5
To adjust project settings in the future, click the three dots next to the project name or right click with the project open.

## Upload and download media

All media that is uploaded lives in the media tab.
###### CREATE FOLDERS
Create folders as needed by right clicking with the project open and selecting “New Folder” or selected “New” in the top right corner and select “New Folder.”
###### UPLOAD
Drag and drop or click “New” in the top right corner and select “File Upload.”
###### DOWNLOAD  
Right click or click the three dots on the file, then select “Download as” for options to appear.

## SHARE MEDIA/LINKS

To share out media, there are two link options. A Review link allows viewers to comment and see others’ comments. A presentation link doesn’t allow comments and has a cleaner interface.
###### Step 1
Select desired file(s) or folder(s) to share, right click or click the three dots in the corner of one of the files. Select Share > Share for Review or Share for Presentation. Note: Share for Presentation may be limited to one file at a time.

###### Step 2
A share window will pop up. This shows the number of items being shared, the file name as well as the link created. To copy the link, click the chain symbol. Avoid adding people by email. Links should be sent out through producers after they’ve watched it through once for quality control.

###### Step 3
In the “Settings” tab, toggle on “Allow downloads,” unless client or producer has specified otherwise. A passphrase or link expiration may also be added here for security purposes. Adjust settings as needed.

###### Step 4
To view settings again after closing out of this window, go to the Review or Presentation tab. This is where the review link or Presentation links live.

## SHARE MEDIA FROM MULTIPLE FOLDERS

###### Step 1
Create the share link with just one file.  
###### Step 2
Go to the Review or Presentation tab, click on the three dots, and select “Add or remove files.”

###### Step 3
To open the folder where the files are located, without selecting the whole folder itself, hover over the folder and select “Go To Folder” when it appears. Then click on the file. To navigate back outside the folder, select a root folder at the top of the page.
###### Step 4
Click “Save” when finished.

## REVIEW WINDOW

The review window for each video on your end reflects the review link view.

###### COMMENTS:  
- Comments can be made by anyone with access to the link at the bottom and will match the current video timecode.
- Comments, emojis or drawings on the frame can be made at a single spot that corresponds with the timecode. Or, after hovering the cursor over that new spot, a cursor arrow can drag the comment to span a longer area.

###### TEAM INTERACTION:  
- Replies or ”thumbs up” can be made to the comments. Depending on settings, email notifications will be sent for comments and replies.
- An “Approved,” “In Progress,” or “Needs Review” status can be set at the top right under the “No Status” dropdown.

###### CHECKLIST:  
- As the editor works, the comments can be checked off like a to-do list. All checked items can be hidden for a concise to-do list.

## VERSION STACKING

For files that have already been shared out but need to be updated without generating or altering the current shared link.

###### Step 1
Upload the new media.
###### Step 2
Drag the new media onto the previous media. The file will then have a new version number in the corner to indicate the version number.
###### Step 3
To access previous versions, double click on the file to open the review window. At the top, select the version number dropdown and the previous versions will be available to select and view.

## COPY TO VAULT MARKETING

As part of the project closeout process, final deliverables will be added to the ”\_Vault Marketing” folder in Frame. If it doesn’t appear, double check your access to this folder - See Access Clients.
###### Step 1
Find the file and click the three dots or right click on the file. Select “Copy to...”
###### Step 2
A window will appear. Search or scroll to “\_Vault Marketing.” Click the dropdown arrow.
###### Step 3
Select the correct client folder. If a client folder doesn’t exist, quit out of this process, navigate to the project and create a new one. See Create New Project.
###### Step 4
Once the correct client is selected, find the corresponding project folder. If none exists, create a new subfolder with the project name by clicking the folder with a plus in the bottom left corner. Click “Copy.”

> [!NOTE]
> No need to include every re-size, variation or deliverable version. Select the hero/primary version(s) to share.
